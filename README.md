### What I learned

I really tried to challenge myself during this project and work on it how I would if I was actually making this for someone else, I'm still getting used to using GitHub and I have trouble remembering to add/commit things. 

This project is on the easier side, but as I'm just starting out I found it fun, but decently challenging for my current level. My biggest hurdle was the JavaScript as I just started learning that not too long ago, It took a very long time to figure out how to change the images on click and I'm really glad I finally got it in the end.

I'm realising very quickly that the more I overthink the more likely I will overcomplicate the problems I'm facing. Now I have no idea how well optimised this is nor do I know if I even did everything correctly, but I'm proud of it and I'm hoping to get any feedback that could help me on my journey moving forward! Thank you for taking the time to read this! I really appreciate it.


### Continued development

I definitely want to learn more JavaScript, I feel like I'm not even brushing the surface of the things I can do with this language. I also feel like I'm not using the best practises when it comes to CSS or HTML for that matter, but at the same time I do feel like I'm learning at a steady pace where I don't feel overly pressured to be absolutely amazing in the projects I'm doing.

Responsiveness in websites is an aspect where I still heavily struggle, regardless of the project. I think I should spend some more time working on responsive projects that are a bit out of my comfort zone, but not so far as to discourage me from continuing my journey. Any feedback or input would be greatly appreciated.


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - This channel has helped so much when It comes to understanding CSS and how It can be used effectively, I really enjoy the style of content and the delivery makes me feel like I'm learning a lot faster than If I was just reading off a website.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp) - This was the biggest help for me to understand how to make the accordion actually function, This helped so much to me.
